# avr-asm

A collection of fiddling I make with avr asm, mostly running on an arduino uno.
So, unless otherwise noted, these projects are for atmega328p.

You will notice that I don't use any external definitions, but hex codes. That's
just me, wanting to experiment on the concept of writing code with nothing but
the datasheet as a reference.
